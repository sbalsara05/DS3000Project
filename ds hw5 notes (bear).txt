notes for homework 5

My proposals, from least to most preferred:

How can one use the fewest pals to have the most evenly capable team?
- Will need to analyze:
  - Dispersal of work capabilities
  - Dispersal of combat stats
- Can be visualized using:
  - Histograms for how many pals there are of any certain type
  - Scatterplot for number of work capabilities vs total combat skills of each pal
  - Bubble chart/Venn diagram showing work capabilities of each pal

What makes a pal high-tier? How does a pal's tier (as listed on palworld.cc) relate to its
  element, region, work suitability, and stats? 
- Will need to analyze:
  - Element
  - Region of origin
  - Work suitability
  - Combat stats
- Can be visualized using:
  - Scatterplot charting combat stats against pal tier
  - Histograms of pal tier for each element/region/work suitability
  - Scatterplot showing all pals' total "score" as a combination of their ranking in the features 
    deemed to be relevant from the last graphs (e.g. if we find no correlation between region and
    tier, then don't include it in this chart) vs their tier. Hopefully this should be very positively
    correlated.
