    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we study Palworld, a survival and monster-taming video game in which players collect characters called Pals to battle each other and help build their bases. Each Pal has a different set of skills and qualifications, a combination of such features as their element type, their HP in battle, and their \"work suitability\" for various tasks like farming or electricity production. We want to learn about how those factors combine and influence each other, and what relationships that may not be stated outwardly can be found between them. This may help players better understand their game and be more successful at it, or at least increase their knowledge of the logic behind Palworld.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary research questions are:\n",
    "- How are a Pal's work suitability scores correlated to its other statistics, such as its element type or battle skills?\n",
    "- What relationship does Pal rarity have with their other statistics?"

    "\n",
    "- All data was taken from [palworld.gg](\"https://palworld.gg\").\n",
    "- We scraped each Pal's name, ID number, rarity, element(s), work suitability type(s) and level(s), HP, and defense scores.\n",
    "- To make the data frame more easily filtered, the Pals' elements were listed using multiple boolean columns, each representing one element.\n",
    "- For that same reason, their work suitabilities were also listed by column, but instead of True or False, each value was the Pal's level in that suitability or Nan if they did not have it. That way, dropna can be used to filter the data frame by element type.\n",
    "- Finally, the Pals' HP and defense stats were converted to numbers in the data frame, so that mathematical operations can be done on those columns.\n",

    "- `scrape_pal_elements()`\n",
